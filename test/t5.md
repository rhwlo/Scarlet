For the last few years, I’ve managed to cook [Swedish cinnamon buns][0] every
year around the same time, usually with some variation: in 2014, I found myself
in Costa Rica and couldn’t find any cardamom (which I deemed necessary) and
ended up making Swedish-inspired dulce de leche buns.

![Dulce-de-leche buns][1]  
They didn’t look very pretty. Also, they failed to rise.

This year I tried out a new recipe, based off of a [milk-free bun recipe in
Swedish][2] and a [cardamom-cinnamon bun recipe][3] that I thought hit a very
good balance.

![Vegan cinnamon buns][4]  
These ones came out fantastic, so I’ll share the recipe:

## Vegan Swedish-style cinnamon buns ##

    powdered_)
